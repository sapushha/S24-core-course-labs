# My best practices within the CI workflow

## Automated Testing

The workflow includes a step for running tests using the pytest framework. Automated testing is a best practice for ensuring the quality and reliability of the codebase.

## Static Code Analysis

The workflow incorporates the use of the Pylint tool to perform static code analysis on the app.py file. Static code analysis helps identify potential issues and maintain code quality.

## Dependency Management

The workflow installs Python dependencies from the requirements.txt file using the pip install command. Managing dependencies through a requirements file is a best practice for reproducibility and consistency across development environments.

## Security Testing

The workflow integrates the Snyk tool for security testing by running the snyk test command. Incorporating security testing as part of the workflow is a best practice for identifying and addressing security vulnerabilities early in the development process.

## Version Control Integration

The workflow uses the actions/checkout action to check out the code from the repository. Integrating version control into the workflow ensures that the latest code changes are included in the automated processes.

## Environment Setup

The workflow sets up the Python environment using the actions/setup-python action, specifying the Python version as 3.10.13 and caching pip dependencies. Setting up a consistent and controlled development environment is a best practice for reproducibility and stability.

## Documentation

While not explicitly mentioned in the workflow, documentation is a best practice for workflow management. Documenting the workflow steps, dependencies, and configurations contributes to better understanding and maintainability.
