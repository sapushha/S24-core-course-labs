# My best practices within the Docker file

## Avoid unnecessary privileges
Follow the principle of least privilege to ensure that your service or
application only has access to the necessary resources and information .

## Use official images when possible:
Official images save time on maintenance as they come with pre-installed
dependencies and follow best practices.

## Exclude unnecessary files with .dockerignore:
Use a .dockerignore file to exclude files and directories that are not relevant
to the build process. This helps reduce the size of the image and improves
build performance .

## Minimize the number of layers:
Reduce the number of layers created in your Dockerfile to optimize image size
and build performance. Each Dockerfile instruction adds a new layer, so
minimizing layers can improve efficiency .

## Keep the Dockerfile simple:
Avoid unnecessary complexity in your Dockerfile. Keep it focused on the
necessary steps to build and run the application. Overly complex Dockerfiles
can be harder to maintain and understand .
