# StatefulSet in Helm Chart

## Stateful Set Exploration

```bash
(venv) PS C:\Users\smash\PyCharmProjects\S24-core-course-labs\k8s> kubectl get po,sts,svc,pvc 

NAME                    READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
pod/app-python-0        1/1     Running     0          72s
pod/app-python-1        1/1     Running     0          72s

## Visits Counts by Pod

```bash
(venv) PS C:\Users\smash\PyCharmProjects\S24-core-course-labs\k8s> kubectl exec pod/app-python-0 -- cat visits_cnt.txt

35
```

```bash
(venv) PS C:\Users\smash\PyCharmProjects\S24-core-course-labs\k8s> kubectl exec pod/app-python-1 -- cat visits_cnt.txt

30
```

The observed behavior is a standard feature of a StatefulSet. Every pod within
a StatefulSet has a distinct network identity and personal storage. This
enables each pod to hold its own state data independently.

Upon receiving a request, only the counter for the pod that processes that
request is increased. This leads to disparate counts among the pods. It's key
to understand that these counts could fluctuate, driven by load balancing and
service routing rules that guide the distribution of user requests to the pods.

Speaking of ordering guarantees, there are instances where a particular
sequence of pod deployment is necessary to establish synchronization and
consistency. For instance, in a database application with multiple replicas, it
may be imperative for the initial pod (index 0) to be active and prepared
before launching the second pod. This procedure allows the second pod to sync
its data from the first, maintaining database uniformity.

On the other hand, in my Flask application, there's no requirement for a
specific sequence of deployment as the pods don't share any resources, with the
exception of the underlying hardware.
